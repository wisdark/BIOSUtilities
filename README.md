## **Dell PFS BIOS Extractor**

![](https://i.imgur.com/Oy1IkcW.png)

#### **Description**

Parses Dell PFS BIOS images and extracts their SPI/BIOS/UEFI firmware components. It supports all Dell PFS revisions and formats, including those which are originally LZMA compressed in ThinOS packages, ZLIB compressed or split in chunks. The output comprises only final firmware components which are directly usable by end users. An optional Advanced user mode is available as well, which additionally extracts firmware Signatures and more Metadata.

#### **Usage**

You can either Drag & Drop or manually enter the full path of a folder containing Dell PFS BIOS images. Optional arguments:
  
* -h or --help : show help message and exit
* -a or --advanced : extract in advanced user mode

#### **Download**

An already built/frozen/compiled binary is provided by me for Windows only. Thus, **you don't need to manually build/freeze/compile it under Windows**. Instead, download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/platomav/BIOSUtilities/releases) tab. To extract the already built/frozen/compiled archive, you need to use programs which support RAR5 compression. Note that you need to manually apply any prerequisites.

#### **Compatibility**

Should work at all Windows, Linux or macOS operating systems which have Python 3.7 support. Windows users who plan to use the already built/frozen/compiled binary must make sure that they have the latest Windows Updates installed which include all required "Universal C Runtime (CRT)" libraries.

#### **Prerequisites**

To run the utility, you do not need any 3rd party tool.

#### **Build/Freeze/Compile with PyInstaller**

PyInstaller can build/freeze/compile the utility at all three supported platforms, it is simple to run and gets updated often.

1. Make sure Python 3.7.0 or newer is installed:

> python --version

2. Use pip to install PyInstaller:

> pip3 install pyinstaller

3. Build/Freeze/Compile:

> pyinstaller --noupx --onefile Dell_PFS_Extract.py

At dist folder you should find the final utility executable

#### **Anti-Virus False Positives**

Some Anti-Virus software may claim that the built/frozen/compiled executable contains viruses. Any such detections are false positives, usually of PyInstaller. You can switch to a better Anti-Virus software, report the false positive to their support, add the executable to the exclusions, build/freeze/compile yourself or use the Python script directly.

## **AMI BIOS Guard Extractor**

![](https://i.imgur.com/p0rrlqv.png)

#### **Description**

Parses AMI BIOS Guard (a.k.a. PFAT, Platform Firmware Armoring Technology) images, extracts their SPI/BIOS/UEFI firmware components and decompiles the Intel BIOS Guard Scripts. It supports all AMI PFAT revisions and formats, including those with nested AMI PFAT structures. The output comprises only final firmware components which are directly usable by end users.

Note that the AMI PFAT structure does not have an explicit component order. AMI's BIOS Guard Firmware Update Tool (AFUBGT) updates components based on the user/OEM provided Parameters and Options. That means that merging all the components together does not usually yield a proper SPI/BIOS/UEFI image. The utility does generate such a merged file with the name "X_00 -- AMI_PFAT_X_DATA_ALL.bin" but it is up to the end user to determine its usefulness. Moreover, any custom OEM data after the AMI PFAT structure are additionally stored in a file with the name "X_YY -- AMI_PFAT_X_DATA_END.bin" and it is once again up to the end user to determine its usefulness. In cases where the trailing custom OEM data include a nested AMI PFAT structure, the utility will process and extract it automatically as well.

#### **Usage**

You can either Drag & Drop or manually enter the full path of a folder containing AMI BIOS Guard (PFAT) images.

* [7-Zip Console](https://www.7-zip.org/) (i.e. 7z.exe)

#### **Build/Freeze/Compile with PyInstaller**

PyInstaller can build/freeze/compile the utility at all three supported platforms, it is simple to run and gets updated often.

1. Make sure Python 3.7.0 or newer is installed:

> python --version

2. Use pip to install PyInstaller:

> pip3 install pyinstaller

3. Build/Freeze/Compile:

> pyinstaller --noupx --onefile Fujitsu_Package_Extract.py

At dist folder you should find the final utility executable

#### **Anti-Virus False Positives**

Some Anti-Virus software may claim that the built/frozen/compiled executable contains viruses. Any such detections are false positives, usually of PyInstaller. You can switch to a better Anti-Virus software, report the false positive to their support, add the executable to the exclusions, build/freeze/compile yourself or use the Python script directly.

## **Award BIOS Module Extractor**

#### **Description**

Parses Award BIOS images and extracts their modules. The utility automatically uses [Igor Pavlov's 7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) tool in order to decompress the initially LZH compressed sub-modules.

#### **Usage**

You can either Drag & Drop or manually enter the full path of a folder containing Award BIOS firmware.

#### **Download**

An already built/frozen/compiled binary is provided by me for Windows only. Thus, **you don't need to manually build/freeze/compile it under Windows**. Instead, download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/platomav/BIOSUtilities/releases) tab. To extract the already built/frozen/compiled archive, you need to use programs which support RAR5 compression. Note that you need to manually apply any prerequisites.

#### **Compatibility**

Should work at all Windows, Linux or macOS operating systems which have Python 3.7 support. Windows users who plan to use the already built/frozen/compiled binary must make sure that they have the latest Windows Updates installed which include all required "Universal C Runtime (CRT)" libraries.
